## 📜 Overview
The original above-mentioned paper explores time series prediction of Land Surface Temperature (LST) using **Multiple Linear Regression** and **Neural Networks**.  
I independently implemented and validated the methodology to deepen my understanding of time series prediction and machine learning. 

**The results of the paper were reproduced for learning purposes only**

## 🔍 Objective  
- Reproduce the results presented in the paper.
- Document challenges and insights gained during reproduction.

## 🛠️ Methods  
**Multiple Linear Regression**:  
- Baseline model for LST prediction.
**RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)** 

 ## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Data
 - Data can be accessed on appropriate requests from the original authors (as mentioned in paper).
